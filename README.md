GOAL: A highly-extensible Pokemon battle simulator, with the ability for the end user to easily add their own abilities, moves, Pokemon, items, etc. Ideally it will be simple to adapt it to a graphical interface and to set up PvP battles. I'm not trying to run Showdown out of business, just trying to fill a niche.

~~PROGRESS: Damage has all appropriate type modifications, speed and priority are implemented, as is protect. Stat mods 
are implemented, as are Swords Dance and Nasty Plot to test as such. The included Mew vs Pikachu demo illustrates as 
much thanks to a non-boosted Psychic doing only 80-94.3%, but a boosted Psychic always taking a KO.~~

PROGRESS: Protect implemented properly, type aliases for moves and pokemon were implemented in order to cut down on long 
type annotations. Abilities are proving to be a challenging thought exercise, and every move is going to be difficult to 
find a spreadsheet on. Move secondary effects, as well, feel a lot like abilities, so i'm a little stuck there.

TODO:
- implement abilities
- implement all moves
- implement move secondary effects
- implement status conditions (para finished)
- implement graphics
- implement online multiplayer (maybe)
- more stuff as i think of it
