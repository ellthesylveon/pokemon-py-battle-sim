GOAL: A highly-extensible Pokemon battle simulator, with the ability for the end user to easily add their own abilities, moves, Pokemon, items, etc. Ideally it will be simple to adapt it to a graphical interface and to set up PvP battles. I'm not trying to run Showdown out of business, just trying to fill a niche.

PROGRESS: Unmodified, neutral damage is calculated perfectly, as are the stats of the Pokemon. There's also some other stuff. I'm not very good at this.
