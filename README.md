GOAL: A highly-extensible Pokemon battle simulator, with the ability for the end user to easily add their own abilities, moves, Pokemon, items, etc. Ideally it will be simple to adapt it to a graphical interface and to set up PvP battles. I'm not trying to run Showdown out of business, just trying to fill a niche.

PROGRESS: Damage has all appropriate type modifications, speed and priority are implemented, as is protect. Battles don't end because I can't figure out how to configure the while loop right this moment.

TODO:
- implement abilities
- implement all moves
- implement move secondary effects
- implement status conditions
- implement graphics
- implement online multiplayer (maybe)
- more stuff as i think of it
